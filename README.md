### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a junior research group leader at the [Friedrich Schiller University](https://www.uni-jena.de/) in Jena, Germany as part of the [Excellence Cluster Balance of the Microverse](https://www.microverse-cluster.de/en/faculty.html). I am interested in the origins and mechanisms of microbial pathogenicity, antibiotic resistance, data visualization, and #Rstats.

You can find out more about my research group at https://barber-lab.com.
