### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a junior research group leader ([Fungal Informatics](https://www.leibniz-hki.de/en/fungal-informatics.html)) at the Leibniz Institute for Natural Product Research and Infection Biology - Hans KnÃ¶ll Institute in Jena, Germany. I am interested in microbial ecology and evolution, data visualization, and #Rstats.
